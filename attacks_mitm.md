# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

A MITM attack happens when a hacker secretly sits between
two people communicating.

# Wrong key
If the sender uses the wrong keys/ hacker's public key by mistake,
the hacker can:
- Decrypt the message
- Read it
- Re-encrypt it
- Forward it

This is why **public key verification is mandatory that means you need to use proper key**.
